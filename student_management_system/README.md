# 📚 My Rust Learning Journey: Student Management System

Welcome to my personal project where I'm exploring Rust through building a student management system! This repository documents my learning process and implementation of various Rust concepts.

## 🎯 What I've Learned

Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- Defining custom types with Rust structs
- Implementing comparison traits (`PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`, `Eq`, `Ord`)
- Working with generics in Rust
- Handling floating-point comparisons
- Implementing a sorting algorithm from scratch

## 💡 Key Implementations

I'm particularly proud of:

- Building a generic quicksort that works with any comparable type
- Creating a multi-level sorting system (grades → age → name)
- Properly handling floating-point comparisons with epsilon values

## 🚀 Next Steps

I plan to enhance this project by:

- Adding more student management features
- Implementing file I/O for persistent storage
- Creating a command-line interface
- Adding unit tests

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my learning journey!

## 🤝 Connect

I'm always eager to learn from others! If you have suggestions or want to discuss Rust, feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.
