# ðŸ”’ Reader-Preference RwSpinLock Implementation

This project implements a reader-writer spin lock synchronization primitive from scratch in Rust. The lock allows multiple concurrent readers while ensuring exclusive access for writers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Understanding reader-writer lock internals and synchronization primitives
- Working with atomic operations in Rust
- Managing thread safety and shared state
- Implementing proper read/write locking mechanisms

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Custom RwSpinLock implementation using atomic operations
- Multiple concurrent readers support
- Exclusive writer access
- Lock-free synchronization
- Spin-waiting mechanism for efficiency

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

The implementation uses two atomic counters:

- `readers`: Tracks number of active readers
- `writer`: Indicates if a writer is active (0 = no writer, 1 = writer active)

Key aspects:

1. Reader acquisition:
   - Check no active writer
   - Increment reader count atomically
   - Double check no writer acquired lock
2. Writer acquisition:
   - Set writer flag atomically
   - Wait for all readers to finish
   - Proceed when no readers present
3. Memory ordering guarantees via Acquire/Release semantics
4. Spin-loop based waiting for better CPU efficiency

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Includes comprehensive tests for:

- Basic read/write functionality
- Multiple concurrent readers
- Writer blocking readers
- Concurrent modifications
- Performance benchmarks vs regular spinlock
